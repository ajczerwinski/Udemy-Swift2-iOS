@implementation Person

// Here, the Person is holding reference to the Backpack, and the
// Backpack is holding reference to the Person. Two strong references
// holding reference is called a Retain Cycle
// NEVER want to have two strong objects pointing to each other
// either in ObjC or Swift. This would prevent the Object from
// disappearing in memory, causing a Memory Leak
// The solution is to make one of the references weak, typically the
// "least important" one. In this case, the Backpack
